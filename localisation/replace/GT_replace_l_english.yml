 adaptability:0 "Bookkeeping"
 adaptability_desc:0 "Sometimes money is short and we need to borrow. Lenders always worry that they will not be paid back. By maintaining meticulous records, we will be able to ensure that everyone gets paid and that will allow us to negotiate lower rates of interest."
 local_rule:0 "Benefits for Mercenaries"
 local_rule_desc:0 "Mercenaries will always look for the best deal, so we need to ensure that mercenaries remain with us. By ensuring we look after our mercenary companies, they will stay loyal for longer and require less direct monetary compensation."
 stable_government:0 "A Modern Clergy"

 cultural_regulations:0 "Conjuring a Superstructure"
 cultural_regulations_desc:0 "Our civil policies will evoke a complexity which engenders a certain desirable set of traits in our citizenry.  Those who embrace it will thrive, those who reject it will be condemned to destitute servitude."
 centralization:0 "Opportunity Cost"
 centralization_desc:0 "Better to attempt to apply our administration to as much land as possible and fail than to idly watch our competitors annex it."
 civil_servants:0 "A Ruthless Bureaucracy"
 civil_servants_desc:0 "Our ministers are myriad and have created state organs which allow us to both fine tune our provinces as well as reliably churn out leaders who are tireless."
 local_traditions:0 "The Question of Cultural Assimilation"
 local_traditions_desc:0 "In our pursuit of empire, we will find no end to the problem of assimilation of foreign cultures.  For this reason, it is prudent for us to convince our own culture to view minority cultures with opportunistic curiosity rather than nationalistic hatred."
 humanist_tolerance:0 "The Question of Heathens"
 humanist_tolerance_desc:0 "What an absolute waste of productive human resources the butchery of heathens would be.  Tolerance of their existence within our borders is proven to yield technological advancements in the long-term.  While they may not be correct in their faith, it would be myopic to discount them entirely."
 ecumenism:0 "Ecumenism"
 ecumenism_desc:0 "The problem with how to manage competing religious views in the realm is always difficult.

 indirect_rule:0 "Indirect Rule"
 indirect_rule_desc:0 "Sometimes the best way to get people to do what you want is to let them believe that they're making their own choices - to this end we can promote "democratic" processes that have been subtly neutuered. Such a system of indirect rule will reduce the unrest in newly acquired provinces and will result in respectful adherence to our decrees rather than disdain."
 diplomatic_influence:0 "Loyal Subjects"
 diplomatic_influence_desc:0 "Our many subjects appreciate our preference towards continuation of thier national identity.  Not pursuing their annexation frees up the diplomatic efforts of our ruler to be applied elsewhere."

 improved_rams:0 "Naval Drill"
 improved_rams_desc:0 "We will not be among the inferior nations that only acquire naval warfare experience outside of peacetime; we will drill our navies in mock battles frequently so that our crew will not be caught off-guard when the real battles arrive, be they deckhands or admirals."
