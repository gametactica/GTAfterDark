#Events
 event_01.1.t:0 "Capital Areas and Great Powers"
 event_01.1.d:0 "During this campaign you will be able to re-integrate your capital area upon loss via a custom decision that will appear for use when applicable.  Also, if and when you achieve 'Great Power' status, you will begin developing a superiority complex which will cause you to view lesser nations and competitors alike with disdain.  This effect will only worsen as you wax in power.  As alliances require high mutual relations, expect to make less use of them as a 'Great Power'."
 event_01.1.a:0 "I hereby accept these terms which are only as just as they benefit me personally."
 event_gain_gp.1.t:0 "Great Power Status Secured"
 event_gain_gp.1.d:0 "Recent victories have set our nation apart from our historic allies and rivals alike.  We've ascended onto the world stage and command enviable power in its purest form.  Those weaker than us will seek favors from us, but we shall rebuke them - they can bend the knee to our reign or they can contest our strength.  Our current alliances will be shed like a fresh molt, no longer needed."
 event_gain_gp.1.a:0 "I guess it is lonely at the top..."
 event_lose_gp.1.t:0 "Great Power Status Disrupted"
 event_lose_gp.1.d:0 "Recent debacles have thrust our nation back into the quagmire of mediocrity.  We've truly fallen from greatness and can no longer afford to wear our narcissism as an armour of contempt.  No one expects much of us anymore...perhaps a cunning alliance can change our fortunes."
 event_lose_gp.1.a:0 "Good heavens, I may die from the sheer humiliation."
 event_lose_land.1.t:0 "An Ill-advised Annexation"
 event_lose_land.1.d:0 "A holding we've acquired recently appears to have fanatically loyal subjects...which would be grand were they loyal to our rule.  Regretably, they are fiercely loyal to their "rightful lord" who previously held the holding.  Should this foreign ruler back a rebellion we would not be able to maintain control..."
 event_lose_land.1.a:0 "Well that sounds precarious!"
 event_gain_land.1.t:0 "Loyalists in Foreign Holdings"
 event_gain_land.1.d:0 "Once our loyalist faction was promised support from our soveriegn they poured out into the streets and easily overwhelmed the occupying forces, which were a mere skeleton crew in comparison."

 event_tag_switch.1.t:0 "New Nation Proclaimed in Capital"
 event_anti_bloc_1.1.t:0 "Burgeoning Alliance"
 event_anti_bloc_1.1.d:0 "Our diplomats report that our current ally is most pleased with the fact that we haven't developed any military alliances with other nations.  This has also resulted in more transparency and trust concerning our dealings with them.  If this trend continues, eventually we may ossify an alliance that stands through the ages."
 event_anti_bloc_1.1.a:0 "We should ensure that our longterm goals align with our current ally..."
 event_anti_bloc_2.1.t:0 "Quarreling Allies"
 event_anti_bloc_2.1.d:0 "Though often we find ourselves able to accommodate the concerns of both of our allies simultaneously, there are other occassions where their concerns are expressly contradictory.  Rather than risking our influence in all foreign courts, we must gravely disappoint one of our allies."
 event_anti_bloc_2.1.a:0 "We should have known we wouldn't be able to foster multiple alliances in perpetuity."
 event_anti_bloc_2.1.b:0 "We can offer them our support on other important matters in exchange for our lack of support on this one."

 event_empowered_subject_remove.1.a:0 "How quaint."
 event_preferred_another.1.t:0 "An Underwhelming Alliance"
 event_preferred_another.1.d:0 "Whenever we propose a mutually beneficial international engagement with our ally we find them unable to commit.  They are perpetually hamstrung by their myriad, entangling alliances.  We've issued them an ultimatum; as expected, they have shown us neither promise nor favor."
 event_preferred_another.1.a:0 "We are losing faith in this alliance."
 event_rebel_control.1.t:0 "End of Rebellions?"
 event_rebel_control.1.d:0 "Though hesitant, the various rebelling factions warmed to the idea of negotiating an end to future rebellions.  Their terms are unwavering and clear; they know that they have the advantage and they are willing to press it if we don't issue considerable concessions.  Their terms will cost us dearly, but we will at least have 15 years to rebuild before worrying about rebels again."
 event_rebel_control.1.a:0 "Meet their demands."

 GT_SuccessionH.1.f:0 "The new Khan's military ability is meager and he has aspirations of settling land."
 GT_SuccessionH.1.g:0 "It is rumored that the new Khan is unable to even mount a horse..."

 GT_SuccessionT.1.a:0 "The new ruler is known to be extremely devout."
 GT_SuccessionT.1.b:0 "The new ruler's character traits are secular in nature."
 GT_SuccessionT.1.c:0 "The new ruler is a known deviant."
 GT_SuccessionPap.1.t:0 "The Politics of the Faith"
 GT_SuccessionPap.1.d:0 "Whenever a new Pope is elected by the College of Cardinals there is potential for foreign influence to debase our nation's sovereignty..."

 GT_SuccessionPap.1.b:0 "The new Pope has clearly been influenced by the nation he hails from."
 GT_SuccessionMam.1.t:0 "Restoring the Caliphate"
 GT_SuccessionMam.1.d:0 "Our nation should not be satisfied with simply acting as custodian of the holy sites.  We must defend and expand Islam at every opportunity so that a Caliph can emerge."
 GT_SuccessionMam.1.a:0 "It is known to all that we alone are fit to defend Islam!"
 GT_SuccessionMam.1.b:0 "Our previous ruler shamefully shirked their duty to Islam."
 GT_SuccessionMng.1.t:0 "An Empire in Name Alone?"

 GT_SuccessionMng.1.a:0 "It is clear to all that we are fit to possess the mandate."
 GT_SuccessionMng.1.b:0 "The mandate is at risk!  Our previous ruler failed to conquer China."
 GT_SuccessionSG.1.t:0 "The elections of the States General"
 GT_SuccessionSG.1.d:0 "As our nation convenes for a new election, we distill the extent and caliber of the federal sentiments which has become firmly rooted within our compromised monarchy.  We can expect a period of pragmatic rule as a display of political viability, if the statists are able to remain entrenched.  If the monarchists become dominant, we can expect a period of violent, reactionary rule as a desperate attempt to defang liberalism."
 GT_SuccessionSG.1.a:0 "The statists are dominant."
 GT_SuccessionSG.1.b:0 "The monarchists are dominant."
 GT_SuccessionDutch.1.t:0 "Curation of the Dutch Republic"
 GT_SuccessionDutch.1.d:0 "As our nation convenes for a new election, we distill the extent and caliber of the federal sentiments which has become firmly rooted within our fledgling republic.  With every election won by the statists our nation is thrust ever-forward into the unknown; we will drag our more traditionally-minded citizens into the future kicking and screaming if we must!  Yet, with each election favoring the Orangist faction, our citizenry exhales a sigh of relief; such periods of more tradional rule will provide stability, but at what future cost?"
 GT_SuccessionDutch.1.a:0 "The statists hold majority representation in our nation presently."
 GT_SuccessionDutch.1.b:0 "The Orangist faction holds majority representation in our nation presently."
 GT_Scoring.1.t:0 "GameTactica Campaign Scoring Interval"
 GT_Scoring.1.d:0 "A campaign host will be pausing the game to collect a save-state so that score can be tracked for this interval."
